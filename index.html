              Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are
              scattered all over this planet; you just need to know where to
              find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and
              the Inca Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk all over
              them. We're proud of our record of successful ascents (over 92% of
              our travellers make it to the top of Kili, depending on the
              route), but it's our CEOs and local guides that make the journey
              itself as memorable as the summit. And if you're not into big
              climbs, don't sweat it; we've got loads of lower-impact walks and
              iconic treks you'll love, too.

              She has booked two major European trips for us in the past year
              and every aspect has met, and in most cases exceeded, our
              expectations. Best prices, best hotels, best itineraries, and best
              cruises, she does it all. But the most important thing is she
              remembers the little things that we would do if we were making the
              plans ourselves.

              Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about 20
              years and there is no one else I would trust to arrange my trips
              and tours. I've also had great fun on a few of the group trips she
              has arranged - Peru & Machu Picchu and a 10-day cruise out of
              Venice and diving. It's always an eclectic group of well traveled,
              interesting people.
